        Find, and click (Catch) the picture of the dog

        This picture will link you to index2.html

---Updates---

V1.1    10/8/2023
        
        The dogphoto is no longer a win condition. Now, the dog photo splits into two with every "catch,"
        and you earn a point for every dog caught.
        
        High score feature added
        
        20% chance on dog capture to spawn a rare green dog. Rare green dog earns 5 points instead of 1.

V1.2    tbd
